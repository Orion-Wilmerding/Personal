Adjustments to Make this code work:

When running npm install to create the node_modules files, two errors appear.
Express.io doesn't link to coffee-script and connect properly.
Udemy section 4: WebRTC Signaling, chp. 14 Setting Up Socket.io Q&A
shows how to fix this
Go to node_modules/express.io/switch.js and remove './node_modules' from
'./node_modules/coffee-script'
Similarly, in express.io/lib/index.coffee remove './node_modules' from 
'./node_modules/connect'
