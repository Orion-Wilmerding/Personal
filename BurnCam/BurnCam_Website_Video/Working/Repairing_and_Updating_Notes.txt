Adjustments to Make this code work:

When running npm install to create the node_modules files, two errors appear.
Express.io doesn't link to coffee-script and connect properly.
Udemy section 4: WebRTC Signaling, chp. 14 Setting Up Socket.io Q&A
shows how to fix this
Go to node_modules/express.io/switch.js and remove './node_modules' from
'./node_modules/coffee-script'
Similarly, in express.io/lib/index.coffee remove './node_modules' from 
'./node_modules/connect'

Next. The URL.createObjectURL(stream) has been depreciated
Replace with this structure:

smallVideoArea.srcObject = stream; // Simplify to srcObject = stream and everything works
//smallVideoArea.src = URL.createObjectURL(stream); // This code is depreciated
